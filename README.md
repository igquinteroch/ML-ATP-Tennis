# ML-ATP-Tennis

## Project's Goal
The purpose is to create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. By analyzing and modeling the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) data, the goal is to determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world.

## Dataset
The data `tennis_stats.csv` is from the menâ€™s professional tennis league, which is called the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals). 

The data provided in the file is from the top 1500 ranked players in the ATP over the span of 2009 to 2017. 

The statistics recorded for each player in each year include service game (offensive) statistics, return game (defensive) statistics and outcomes.
